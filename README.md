### Author: [Olav Tollefsen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olavtollefsen/)

## Introduction

This article shows how to build an OpenThread Border Router using a Raspberry Pi and a Silicon Labs Matter / Thread Development Board

This article is based on Silicon Labs Gecko SDK version 4.4.0

### What you will need

- A PC running Windows as the development workstation.
- Install Simplicity Studio V5 from Silicon Labs.
- Raspberry Pi Model 3B or newer
- Silicon Labs xG24-DK2601B EFR32xG24 Dev Kit (or similar supported board).

## Concepts and overall scenario

The OpenThread Border Router concepts and overall scenario are described here:

https://openthread.io/guides/border-router

## Prepare the Raspberry Pi

Use Ubuntu as the operating system for Raspberry Pi.

We will be using OpenThread Border Router running in a Docker container.

To prepare the Raspberry Pi follow the instructions found here:

https://openthread.io/guides/border-router/docker

## Prepare the Silicon Labs Dev Kit to run the Radio Co-Processor (RCP) application

Connect your Silicon Labs Dev Kit to your PC using an USB cable and run Simplicity Studio.

### Prepare the Bootloader

Find the "Bootloader - SoC Internal Storage (single image on 1536kB device)" example project and create a new project from it. This bootloader is for the Silicon Labs xG24-DK2601B EFR32xG24 Dev Kit, which has 1536kB Flash.

Build the bootloader project, find the .s37 image file and flash it to your Silicon Labs Dev Kit.

### Prepare the OpenThread RCP application

Find the "OpenThread - RCP" example project and create a new project from it.

Build the project, find the .s37 image file and flash it to your Silicon Labs Dev Kit.

## Install the OpenThread Border Router software on a Raspberry Pi (not using Docker image)

### Prepare the Raspberry Pi

Flash an approperiate version of the Raspberry Pi OS.

![Raspberry PI OS](./images/raspberry-pi-os.png)

### Update the OS

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
```

### Install Git

```
$ sudo apt install git
```

### Clone the OTBR repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/openthread/ot-br-posix
```

### Install dependencies

```
$ cd ot-br-posix
$ ./script/bootstrap
```

### Compile and install OTBR

```
INFRA_IF_NAME=eth0 ./script/setup
```

### Reboot the Raspberry Pi

The OTBR service should start on boot.

Verify that all required services are enabled:

```
$ sudo systemctl status
```

## Run the OpenThread Border Router software on a Raspberry Pi using the Docker image (not working)

### Install Docker

```
$ sudo snap install docker
```

### Create the docker group and add your user:

```
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

You may need to reboot for the group membership to take effect.

### Run OpenThread Border Router on the Raspberry Pi

Connect the Silicon Labs Dev Kit to an USB-port on the Raspberry Pi. A new port should appear under /dev. Typically named ttyACM0.

Remember to load the kernel modules for iptables:

```
$ sudo modprobe ip6table_filter
```

Make it permanent

```
sudo nano /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf
```

Add a line with "ip6table_filter" and save.

Check if the "ip6table_filter" module is loaded:

```
lsmod | grep ip6table_filter
```

Run the following Docker command:

```
$ docker run --sysctl "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 net.ipv4.conf.all.forwarding=1 net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1" -p 8080:80 --dns=127.0.0.1 -it --volume /dev/ttyACM0:/dev/ttyACM0 --privileged openthread/otbr --radio-url spinel+hdlc+uart:///dev/ttyACM0
```

The OpenThread Border Router should now be running.

## Form a Thread network

Open the IP-address of your Raspberry Pi on port 8080 to open the OpenThread Border Router Web Application.

Click on Form in the menu and then click on the "Form" button.

## Build Matter

The following steps are documented here: https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/blob/master/docs/guides/BUILDING.md

### Checking out the Matter code

```
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip.git
```

### Updating Matter code

```
$ cd connectedhomeip/
$ git pull
$ git submodule update --init

```

### Installing prerequisites on Raspberry Pi 4

#### Installing prerequisites on Linux

```
$ sudo apt-get install git gcc g++ pkg-config libssl-dev libdbus-1-dev \
     libglib2.0-dev libavahi-client-dev ninja-build python3-venv python3-dev \
     python3-pip unzip libgirepository1.0-dev libcairo2-dev libreadline-dev
```

#### Install some Raspberry Pi specific dependencies:

```
$ sudo apt-get install pi-bluetooth avahi-utils
```

### Configuring wpa_supplicant for storing permanent changes

By default, wpa_supplicant is not allowed to update (overwrite) configuration. If you want the Matter application to be able to store the configuration changes permanently, you need to make the following changes:

1. Edit the dbus-fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1.service file to use configuration file instead by running the following command:

```
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/dbus-fi.w1.wpa_supplicant1.service
```

2. Change the wpa_supplicant start parameters to::

```
ExecStart=/sbin/wpa_supplicant -u -s -i wlan0 -c /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

3. Add the wpa-supplicant configuration file by running the following command:

```
sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
```

4. Add the following content to the wpa-supplicant file:

```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/run/wpa_supplicant
update_config=1
```

5. Reboot your Raspberry Pi.

### Prepare for building

Before running any other build command, the scripts/activate.sh environment setup script should be sourced at the top level. This script takes care of downloading GN, ninja, and setting up a Python environment with libraries used to build and test.

```
source scripts/activate.sh
```

If this script says the environment is out of date, it can be updated by running:

```
source scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

The scripts/bootstrap.sh script re-creates the environment from scratch, which is expensive, so avoid running it unless the environment is out of date.

### Building and running the CHIP Tool

```
mkdir out
$ ./scripts/examples/gn_build_example.sh examples/chip-tool out
```

## Test Matter Fabric with devices

...

#### Form a new Thread network

        sudo ot-ctl factoryreset
        sleep 3
        sudo ot-ctl srp server disable
        sudo ot-ctl thread stop
        sudo ot-ctl ifconfig down
        sudo ot-ctl dataset init new
        sudo ot-ctl dataset commit active
        sudo ot-ctl srp server enable
        sudo ot-ctl ifconfig up
        sudo ot-ctl thread start

### Obtaining Thread network credentials

When running directly on hardware:

```
sudo ot-ctl dataset active -x | sed -n 1p | sed -e "s/\r//g"
```

When running in Docker container

```
$ docker exec -it <container_id> sh -c "sudo ot-ctl dataset active -x"
```
